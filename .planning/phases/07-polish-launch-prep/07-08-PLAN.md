<objective>
Create marketing/SEO pages: landing page and pricing page in a separate (marketing) route group. Move the current root page to the marketing layout.

Purpose: VroomX needs a public-facing presence for SEO and customer acquisition. Landing page communicates the value proposition. Pricing page shows tier comparison. These pages must be separate from the dashboard layout to avoid loading auth/sidebar code.

Output: Marketing route group with landing page, pricing page, and clean layout. SEO metadata on all pages.

    Create `src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`:
    - Server Component (no 'use client')
    - Minimal layout: just a marketing-specific header and footer wrapper
    - No auth checks, no sidebar, no QueryProvider
    - Header: VroomX logo (text-based), nav links (Features, Pricing), Login/Sign Up buttons
    - Footer: Copyright, links to pricing/login
    - Use Tailwind for styling, no complex animations

    ```tsx
    import Link from 'next/link'
    import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

    export default function MarketingLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
          <header className="border-b bg-background">
            <div className="container mx-auto flex h-16 items-center justify-between px-4">
              <Link href="/" className="text-xl font-bold text-primary">VroomX</Link>
              <nav className="flex items-center gap-6">
                <Link href="/pricing" className="text-sm text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground">Pricing</Link>
                <Link href="/login"><Button variant="ghost" size="sm">Log In</Button></Link>
                <Link href="/signup"><Button size="sm">Start Free Trial</Button></Link>
              </nav>
            </div>
          </header>
          <main className="flex-1">{children}</main>
          <footer className="border-t py-8 text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            <p>&copy; {new Date().getFullYear()} VroomX. All rights reserved.</p>
          </footer>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

    Create `src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx`:
    - Server Component with `export const metadata` for SEO
    - Metadata: title "VroomX - Modern TMS for Vehicle Transport Carriers", description targeting keywords
    - Hero section:
      - Large heading: "Dispatch Smarter. Deliver Faster."
      - Subheading: "The modern TMS built for vehicle transport carriers. Orders, trips, drivers, billing, and a driver app — all in one platform."
      - Two CTA buttons: "Start Free Trial" (primary, links to /signup) and "View Pricing" (outline, links to /pricing)
    - Features section (3-column grid on lg, stack on mobile):
      - Card 1: "Order Management" - Create orders, track statuses, bulk import via CSV
      - Card 2: "Trip Dispatch" - Build trips, assign orders, track financials in real time
      - Card 3: "Driver App" - iOS app for inspections, BOL generation, and expense tracking
      - Card 4: "Billing & Invoicing" - Invoice brokers, track aging, monitor collections
      - Card 5: "Fleet Management" - Trucks, trailers, documents, all in one place
      - Card 6: "Multi-Tenant Security" - Your data is isolated. Row-level security on every table.
    - Each feature card: icon from lucide-react, heading, 1-sentence description
    - CTA banner at bottom: "Ready to modernize your dispatch operation?" with signup button
    - Use shadcn/ui Card components for feature cards
    - Keep content concise and scannable

    Update `src/app/page.tsx`:
    - Delete the old placeholder content
    - Replace with a redirect to the marketing page:
      ```tsx
      import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
      export default function RootPage() {
        redirect('/')
      }
      ```
    - Actually, since (marketing)/page.tsx handles "/" via the route group, the root page.tsx may conflict. The solution: DELETE `src/app/page.tsx` entirely since `(marketing)/page.tsx` will serve the "/" route. If Next.js needs a root page.tsx for some reason, keep it as a simple redirect. Test which approach works.
    - NOTE: The root `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx` both map to "/". Next.js App Router uses route groups to resolve this: the (marketing) group's page.tsx takes precedence since it's more specific with a layout. If there's a conflict, rename root page.tsx to something else or delete it.

    Create `src/app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx`:

    - Page heading: "Simple, Transparent Pricing"
    - Subheading: "Start with a 14-day free trial. No credit card required to explore."

    - Features: Up to 5 trucks, Up to 3 team members, Order management, Trip dispatch, Basic billing, iOS driver app

      - CTA Button (full width at bottom)

    FAQ section below pricing cards (simple accordion or static Q&A):
    - "What happens after my free trial?" -> "Your subscription begins. Cancel anytime from your dashboard."
    - "Can I change plans later?" -> "Yes, upgrade or downgrade instantly from Settings."
    - "Is my data secure?" -> "Every table uses row-level security. Your data is completely isolated."
