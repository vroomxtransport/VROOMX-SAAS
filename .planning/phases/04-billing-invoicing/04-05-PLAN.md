<objective>
Build the Billing page with broker-grouped receivables table, aging analysis, batch actions (send invoices, mark paid), and collection rate metric. Update sidebar navigation from "Invoices" to "Billing".

Purpose: This is the primary financial dashboard — dispatchers see who owes money, how much, and how long overdue. Batch operations save time on high-volume payment processing. This completes the billing UI.

Output: Full billing page at `/billing` with receivables table, aging analysis, batch actions, collection rate, and updated sidebar navigation.

  <name>Task 1: Update sidebar navigation and create billing page shell</name>
  <files>
    src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx
    src/app/(dashboard)/billing/page.tsx
    src/app/(dashboard)/billing/_components/collection-rate.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **Step 1: Update sidebar.tsx**

    Change the "Invoices" nav item to "Billing":
    ```typescript
    // Before:
    { name: 'Invoices', href: '/invoices', icon: Receipt, minRole: 'admin' },
    // After:
    { name: 'Billing', href: '/billing', icon: Receipt, minRole: 'admin' },
    ```

    **Step 2: Create `src/app/(dashboard)/billing/page.tsx`**

    Server component page that fetches data and renders the billing dashboard.

    ```typescript
    import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
    import { fetchBrokerReceivables, fetchAgingAnalysis, fetchCollectionRate } from '@/lib/queries/receivables'
    import { ReceivablesTable } from './_components/receivables-table'
    import { AgingTable } from './_components/aging-table'
    import { CollectionRate } from './_components/collection-rate'
    ```

    Page layout:
    1. **Header:** "Billing" title with collection rate metric card on the right
    2. **Receivables section:** ReceivablesTable with batch actions toolbar
    3. **Aging Analysis section:** AgingTable below receivables (same scroll, per CONTEXT.md)

    Fetch all three data sources server-side:
    ```typescript
    const supabase = await createClient()
    const [receivables, aging, collection] = await Promise.all([
      fetchBrokerReceivables(supabase),
      fetchAgingAnalysis(supabase),
      fetchCollectionRate(supabase),
    ])
    ```

    Wrap the client components in a `<BillingClient>` wrapper if needed for interactivity (checkbox state, batch actions). Alternatively, make the page a server component that passes data as props to client components.

    **Step 3: Create `src/app/(dashboard)/billing/_components/collection-rate.tsx`**

    A client component showing the collection rate metric.

    Props: `{ totalInvoiced: number; totalCollected: number; rate: number }`

    Display:
    - Large percentage number (e.g., "87%")
    - Label: "Collection Rate"
    - Sub-text: "$X collected of $Y invoiced"
    - Visual: circular progress indicator or simple bar
    - Color: green if >= 80%, amber if >= 60%, red if < 60%

    Use compact formatting for large numbers.

  <done>Sidebar shows "Billing" at /billing. Billing page fetches receivables, aging, and collection rate data server-side. Collection rate displays as a prominent metric card.</done>

  <action>
    **Step 1: Create `src/app/(dashboard)/billing/_components/receivables-table.tsx`**

    A `'use client'` component showing broker-grouped receivables.

    Props: `{ receivables: BrokerReceivable[] }`

    Layout:
    1. **Table with columns:**
       - Checkbox (for row selection — used by batch actions)
       - Broker Name (clickable, navigates to `/brokers/{id}` per CONTEXT.md)
       - Total Owed (formatted currency, right-aligned)
       - Invoice Count
       - Oldest Unpaid (formatted date)
       - Paid This Month (formatted currency)
       - Overdue Amount (formatted currency, red if > 0)

    2. **Expandable rows:** Clicking the expand icon on a broker row reveals the individual orders:
       - Order number, carrier pay, amount paid, remaining, payment status badge, invoice date
       - Each order row has its own checkbox for batch selection

    3. **State management:**
       - `selectedOrderIds: Set<string>` — tracks checked orders across all brokers
       - `expandedBrokers: Set<string>` — tracks which broker rows are expanded
       - Pass `selectedOrderIds` and `onSelectionChange` up to parent for batch actions

    4. **Empty state:** "No outstanding receivables" message.

    Use shadcn/ui Table, Checkbox components. Use `Intl.NumberFormat` for currency (follow existing `formatCurrency` pattern from order-detail.tsx).

    **Step 2: Create `src/app/(dashboard)/billing/_components/aging-table.tsx`**

    A `'use client'` component showing aging analysis.

    Props: `{ aging: AgingRow[] }`

    Layout:
    1. **Section header:** "Aging Analysis" with subtitle
    2. **Table with columns:**
       - Broker Name
       - Current (green text/bg)
       - 1-30 Days (yellow text/bg)
       - 31-60 Days (orange text/bg)
       - 61-90 Days (red text/bg)
       - 90+ Days (dark red text/bg)
       - Total

    3. **Color coding per CONTEXT.md:**
       - Current: `text-green-700 bg-green-50`
       - 1-30: `text-yellow-700 bg-yellow-50`
       - 31-60: `text-orange-700 bg-orange-50`
       - 61-90: `text-red-700 bg-red-50`
       - 90+: `text-red-900 bg-red-100`

    4. **Drill-down:** Clicking a bucket cell shows the specific orders for that broker/bucket. Implement as a modal or inline expand (Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md). Recommended: inline expand showing order list below the clicked row.

    5. **Totals row:** Sum of all brokers per column at the bottom.

    6. **Empty state:** "No aging data — no invoiced orders found."

    **Step 3: Create `src/app/(dashboard)/billing/_components/batch-actions.tsx`**

    A `'use client'` component toolbar that appears when orders are selected.

    Props:
    ```typescript
    interface BatchActionsProps {
      selectedOrderIds: string[]
      onClear: () => void
    }
    ```

    Layout (sticky toolbar at top of receivables section, visible when selection.length > 0):
    1. **Selection count:** "{N} orders selected"
    2. **"Send Invoices" button:**
       - For each selected orderId, call `POST /api/invoices/${orderId}/send` individually (NOT batch API — Resend doesn't support attachments in batch)
       - Use `Promise.allSettled()` to handle partial failures
       - Show progress: "Sending 3/5..."
       - On complete: toast with "X invoices sent, Y failed"
       - Invalidate orders query
    3. **"Mark Paid" button:**
       - Opens a small popover/dialog asking for payment date (default: today)
       - Calls `batchMarkPaid(selectedOrderIds, paymentDate)` server action
       - On complete: toast with "X orders marked as paid"
       - Invalidate orders query and clear selection
    4. **"Clear Selection" button**

    Use sonner for toast notifications. Use shadcn/ui Popover for the date picker dialog.
