## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-02-11 22:03 UTC
**Stopped at:** Completed 01-06-PLAN.md
**Resume file:** None

## Context for Next Session

**What was just completed:**
- Plan 01-06 executed successfully in 2 min
- Email confirmation route handles PKCE and OTP auth verification flows
- Logout Server Action with session clearing and cache revalidation
- Upgraded auth forms to React 19 useActionState pattern
- Inline error messages without URL parameter dependency
- Loading states on submit buttons with isPending
- 2 atomic commits: 1ebe1f4 (auth-confirm/logout), 33944f2 (useActionState upgrade)

**Next action:** Execute Plan 01-07 (Dashboard UI) or 01-08 (Billing Page)

**Auth lifecycle now complete:**
- Signup flow: form → create user → create tenant → Stripe Checkout → dashboard
- Email confirmation: /auth-confirm route exchanges tokens for session
- Login flow: credentials → verify → redirect to dashboard
- Logout flow: sign out → revalidate cache → redirect to login
- Modern form UX: inline errors, loading states, recoverable errors

**Pattern established for future forms:**
- Use `useActionState(serverAction, null)` for client forms
- Server Actions accept `(prevState, formData)` signature
- Return `{ error: string }` on validation/error, `redirect()` on success
- Extract `isPending` from useActionState for loading UI

Phase 1 is the foundation — it creates the Next.js project, Supabase schema with RLS, auth flows, and Stripe integration. Everything else depends on it.
